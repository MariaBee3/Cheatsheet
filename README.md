# Cheatsheet
Cheatsheet CSS Selectors - Codecademy

This simple site, build only with HTML5 and CSS3 was one of my first websites. You never have to cheat again.

## Idea
The assignment was to build your own Cheat Sheet using HTML tables and a customized color scheme.

## Approach
As I am more visually focused I chose to add an illustration as a banner. The color scheme was adjusted to this illustration.

## Challenges
As it was my first time working with a banner background image, I had some issues getting it to stay centered and not repeating itself in larger screens.
